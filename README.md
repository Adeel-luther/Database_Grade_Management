# Database_Grade_Management
Project 
this is the code of the database that contains three tables: "students", "courses", and "teachers". 
The "students" table has attributes for student name, roll number, and class. 
The "courses" table has attributes for course name and code.
The "teachers" table has attributes for teacher name and email. 
Additionally, it will create two linking tables: "student_courses" and "teacher_courses" to 
establish many-to-many relationships between students and courses, and teachers and courses. The linking tables have attributes for
the corresponding student/teacher and course, and are linked as foreign keys to their respective tables.
